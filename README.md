# Examples of bad UI/UX in our daily life 

## Outline

## 1. Security Door Downstairs
We know that our department has a security door downstairs designed to deter intruders. But, this door is **lethal** to the inhabitants of this department in my opinion.

First, there is no fail safe system implemented. This is dangerous because when the power is down, all of the inhabitants will be locked, unable to escape. Imagine if there is a power failure and an earthquake happening at the same time.

Second, to open this door from the inside, you need to push a button to open the door. But, if you push the button too hard, it may prevent to locking mechanism from disengaging. This is not a good design in my opinion.

## 2. Bukalapak
[Bukalapak](https://bukalapak.com) is an online marketplace designed to provide users solutions for their needs. Although this website is great, it does have some bad user interfaces in my opinion.

When you go to the services category, (PLN payment, investment, vouchers, etc), you will be provided with an array of options for you to select. But, the options comes with buttons that is similar in color and small text that may confuse some people.
